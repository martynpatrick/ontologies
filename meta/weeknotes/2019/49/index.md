# 2019 - Week 49

The week kicked off with Libarian Jayne and [Michael](https://twitter.com/fantasticlife) making more tweaks to the [SI procedure maps](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html#flowcharts) and data. All motions across the four procedures now have the opportunity to lapse at prorogation / dissolution. They still need to sit down and do the same for [treaties](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/flowcharts/crag-treaties/crag-treaties.pdf). Which is unfortunate given their Lordships' tendencies toward motion explosion.

On Tuesday, [Anya](https://twitter.com/bitten_) and Michael met with House of Lords Anna Murphy and [Ben](https://twitter.com/benwoodhams) to talk through the work done by [Rad](https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/academic-faculty/radoslaw-zubek.html), [Tom](https://twitter.com/tomgfleming) and [Niels](https://twitter.com/NielsGoet) on parsing and capturing changes to [House of Commons Public Standing Orders](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmstords/1154/toc.htm) over time. Talk once again turned to our longstanding wish to see Standing Orders (SOs) given persistent identifiers. No one suggested this was a terrible idea. Anna mentioned the overhead of having to check footnote links to SOs every time the [Companion](https://www.parliament.uk/documents/publications-records/House-of-Lords-Publications/Rules-guides-for-business/Companion-to-standing-orders/Companion-to-Standing-Orders-2017.pdf) is republished, so it seems we are not alone in our desire for a citation format for a SO that does not change with renumbering.

Still on the subject of Standing Orders and the citation thereof Michael has been approximating a look of busy, by grabbing the [ParlRules data](https://parlrulesdata.org/), loading it into Postgres and poking at it somewhat randomly with Ruby. Normalisation is happening and a shape is starting to emerge.

On Thursday, Ben talked incessantly about amendment groupings and ungroupings and [marshalled lists](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldbills/101/amend/ldam101.htm) and daily lists and the difficulties involved in bringing all that together whilst Michael and [Silver](https://twitter.com/silveroliver) tried to [keep up on a whiteboard](https://twitter.com/fantasticlife/status/1202558118162509824). Somewhat unusually they also had a guest in the shape of [Adam](https://twitter.com/chairlord) from the [FSA](https://www.food.gov.uk/). There is half a plan to see if we can re-use our [procedure model](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html) to capture some of the food standards process flows that become UK competencies post Brexit. The registering of slaughterhouses being quite a change from public bill procedure.
