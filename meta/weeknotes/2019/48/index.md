# 2019 - Week 48

Librarian Jayne and [Michael](https://twitter.com/fantasticlife) once more attacked the [SI and treaty procedures](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html#flowcharts) with precision honed pliers. Draft procedures are now fully session end compliant. Made affirmative and made negative instruments need some work. Treaties are being put off for better days.

Thursday saw a meeting with Paul and Martyn. We're not snobs, but we like to think we work with the brightest and best. The meeting was supposed to cover decideable things and decisions, but Paul took Michael's pen and proceeded to give a masterclass in procedure, mostly around selection and groupings and orderings of considerations of things. When Michael finally got his pen back, Paul and Martyn pored over the Parliament Act and some tidies of money bills and bills previously rejected by the Lords but subject to said Act were made. These are now in the [flowchart](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/flowcharts/bills/public-bill.pdf) awaiting a decision on whether they're lacking a marker for a ‘decision’ or not.
