# 2019 - Week 29

## Last week

[Anya](https://twitter.com/bitten_) and [Michael](https://twitter.com/fantasticlife) talked Dominic through the [procedure model](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html) and logic gates and [associated flowcharts](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/procedure-ontology.html#flowcharts).

Michael met with [Ben](https://twitter.com/benwoodhams) to tick some additional boxes around second readings in the House of Lords.

Robert and Michael decanted a little more detail from the whiteboard session with [David](https://twitter.com/clerkly) and [Matt](https://twitter.com/mattkorris) into [documentation](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/flowcharts/bills/public-bill.pdf).

Michael gave a talk to clerkly types on [agile](https://agilemanifesto.org/), [Cynefin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework), [Domain Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design), [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), [Behaviour Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) and assorted other DDs which he hopes was not too nutbag.

Michael found a plotter in the library. This means we have large printouts of bill procedure that are close to being legible. Please shout if you'd like a truly handsome artefact to decorate your office.

## This week

We have a couple of prearranged meetings with external people lined up, namely [John](https://twitter.com/johnlsheridan) and [David](https://twitter.com/clerkly). Otherwise, we're putting public bill procedure modelling on hold for a while.
