# Week 26

Your second in a semi-regular series of updates on what we’re up to with modelling public bills and public bill procedure.

## This week

On Tuesday, Robert and [Michael](https://twitter.com/fantasticlife) spent an hour squinting at photos of the whiteboard they’d filled with bits of Richard’s brains last week. A few extra bits were [decanted into the flowchart](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/procedure/flowcharts/bills/public-bill.pdf).

On Wednesday, there was a second meeting with Richard. He spotted some problems with our logic flow around Queen's and Prince of Wales' Consent and second reading. These are fixed now.

On Friday Michael gave Dominic a brief introduction to how we work and why and how we use [Domain Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design). It was a useful dry run for further sessions we’re planning. A trifle nutbag in parts perhaps but none the worse for that.

## Next week
                
A further hour is booked in with Richard, possibly looking at 3rd readings, 10 min rule bills and carry overs motions.
                
On Tuesday, [Matthieu](https://twitter.com/cognithive), Robert and Michael are meeting to discuss the approach to implementing logic gates in the procedure model.
                
On Thursday [Anya](https://twitter.com/bitten_), Robert and Michael have 2 hours booked in with [David](https://twitter.com/clerkly) and [Matt](https://mobile.twitter.com/MattKorris) to dip a first toe into House of Lords procedural waters.
                
And on Friday, Anya, Robert and Michael are meeting Martyn and Adam to get fresh eyes over what we have so far for House of Commons procedure.
