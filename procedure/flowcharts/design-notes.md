# Handling debates

If a neutral motion is debated - a motion that does not result in a decision being taken - we specialise the Chamber debate step.

If a motion is meta - where its primary topic is not the work packageable thing but a request to tweak the implementation of the procedure - we specialise the Chamber debate step.

If the motion's primary topic is the workpackageable thing but it does not require the House to come to a view, we do not specialise the Chamber debate step.
